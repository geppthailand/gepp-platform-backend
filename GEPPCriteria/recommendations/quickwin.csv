1,Simple_Signage_Fix,"waste_segregation_quality < -0.08 AND waste_segregation_quality > -0.15 AND contamination_risk_index > 0.05 AND contamination_risk_index < 0.25","Moderate segregation quality decline with manageable contamination. Often caused by unclear or missing signage. Quick, low-cost intervention can reverse trend before serious deterioration.","Immediate action: Audit all waste station signage for clarity, visibility, and condition. Replace faded, damaged, or confusing signs. Add visual guides (pictures of items) not just text. Use consistent color coding. Ensure multilingual signage if needed. Add 'contamination examples' showing what NOT to include. Budget: ~$500-2000, Timeline: 1-2 weeks, Impact: 10-20% segregation improvement."
2,Bin_Placement_Optimization,"recycling_efficiency_score < -30 AND recycling_efficiency_score > -60 AND general_waste_minimization < -40","Declining recycling with increasing general waste. Often caused by inconvenient bin placement - people use whatever bin is closest. Simple relocation can significantly improve performance.","Walk facility with staff to identify convenience gaps. Place recycling bins directly adjacent to general waste (paired placement). Add recycling bins in high-generation areas (break rooms, copy rooms, near vending). Remove general waste from areas where recyclables generated. Ensure adequate capacity. Budget: ~$1000-5000 for bins, Timeline: 1-3 weeks, Impact: 15-25% recycling increase."
3,Quick_Training_Refresh,"waste_segregation_quality < -0.10 AND overall_waste_reduction_rate < -80 AND overall_waste_reduction_rate > -200","Moderate performance decline across metrics.
