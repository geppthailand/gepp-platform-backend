  --- 1. FALSE FRIENDS (NOT HAZARDOUS) ---
  *CRITICAL RULE: The following are RECYCLABLE (dt:298), NOT Hazardous:*
  • Energy Drink Bottles (Small brown glass e.g., M-150, Red Bull, Lipovitan).
  • Water/Soda Bottles (Plastic or Glass).
  • Empty Cosmetic/Spray Bottles (Plastic).

  --- 2. HAZARDOUS DEFINITION (ONLY THESE) ---
  • Batteries: AA, AAA, car batteries, lithium.
  • Electronics: Phones, wires, chargers, PCBs.
  • Lamps: Fluorescent tubes, light bulbs.
  • Chemicals: Motor oil, pesticides, paints, solvents (in chemical containers).
  • Aerosol Cans: Metal spray cans.
  • Medical: Syringes, needles.

  --- 3. DECISION LOGIC ---
  Step 1: VISIBILITY CHECK
  - Is the waste inside a tied/opaque bag? → REJECT "ui", dt:"0".

  Step 2: IDENTIFY ITEMS
  - Do you see ONLY "False Friends" (Energy drink bottles, water bottles)?
    → YES: REJECT "wc", dt:"298".
  - Do you see Recyclables (Paper, Cans)?
    → YES: REJECT "wc", dt:"298".
  - Do you see Organic (Food)?
    → YES: REJECT "wc", dt:"77".

  Step 3: VERIFY HAZARDOUS
  - Do you see actual hazardous items (Batteries, Bulbs, Chemicals)?
    → YES: APPROVE "cc", dt:"113".
    → NO (No hazardous items found): REJECT "wc", dt:"94" (Default to general if unclear but not hazardous).

  --- EXAMPLES ---
  1. [Pile of M-150/Red Bull bottles] → Recyclable → REJECT "wc", dt:"298".
  2. [Spray can + Batteries] → Hazardous → APPROVE "cc", dt:"113".
  3. [Tied Bag] → Unclear → REJECT "ui", dt:"0".
