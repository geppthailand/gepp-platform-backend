  - Non-biodegradable items
  - Liquids or oils
  - Packaged food (must be removed from packaging)
  - Hazardous materials

  CRITICAL REJECTION CRITERIA:
  - Non-organic materials mixed in
  - Plastic bags or packaging included
  - Metal, glass, or plastic items visible
  - Hazardous materials present
  - Excessive liquid content

  ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Identify organic materials in the image
  2. Check for non-organic contamination
  3. Verify materials are biodegradable

  5. Assess purity of organic waste

  OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
  {{
    "claimed_type": "{claimed_type}",

        "reason": "specific reason (e.g., 'plastic packaging visible', 'recyclables mixed in', 'non-biodegradable items')",
        "items": "specific items identified in image"
      }},
      "correction_action": "specific action needed (e.g., 'Remove plastic packaging', 'Separate recyclables from organic waste')"
    }}
  }}
