# GRI Module - Global Reporting Initiative Waste Management Standards

## Overview

This module implements comprehensive support for GRI 306 Waste standards (2020 version), enabling organizations to track, report, and analyze their waste management performance according to global sustainability reporting standards.

## GRI 306 Standards Coverage

### GRI 306-1: Waste Generation and Significant Waste-Related Impacts
- **Focus**: Understanding waste generation sources and impacts
- **Key Metrics**: 
  - Waste generation by source
  - Significant waste-related impacts
  - Value chain waste assessment
  - Upstream and downstream impacts

### GRI 306-2: Management of Significant Waste-Related Impacts
- **Focus**: Actions to prevent waste and manage impacts
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Waste prevention initiatives
  - Circularity measures
  - Management processes
  - Stakeholder engagement
  - Impact mitigation actions

### GRI 306-3: Waste Generated
- **Focus**: Total waste generated by composition
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Total waste by material type
  - Hazardous vs non-hazardous waste
  - Waste composition breakdown
  - Temporal trends
  - Geographic distribution

### Additional Standards (Future Ready)
- **GRI 306-4**: Waste diverted from disposal
- **GRI 306-5**: Waste directed to disposal

## Module Architecture

```
models/gri/
├── standards.py     # GRI standards and aspects definitions
├── reporting.py     # Unified reporting data model
├── goals.py         # Goal setting and target management
└── analytics.py     # Analytics and export capabilities
```

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Data Model
- Single table for all GRI 306 data with type classification
- Flexible schema supporting all waste-related metrics
- JSON fields for extensible data capture

### 2. Goal Management
- User-defined targets for each GRI aspect
- Progress tracking against targets
- Automated KPI calculations
- Alert system for deviations

### 3. Reporting Capabilities
- Period-based reporting (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Multi-dimensional analysis (material, location, time)
- Comparative reporting (YoY, QoQ)
- Automated report generation

### 4. Analytics & Export
- Pre-built dashboard templates
- Custom metric calculations
- Multiple export formats (Excel, PDF, CSV, JSON)
- API endpoints for BI tool integration

## Data Model Design

### Core Principle: Unified Table Approach
```sql
gri_reports
├── gri_type (306-1, 306-2, 306-3)
├── reporting_period
├── metrics_data (JSON)
├── calculations
└── compliance_status
```

### Benefits:
- **Simplified Queries**: Single table for all GRI 306 data
- **Flexible Schema**: JSON fields for varying metric requirements
- **Easy Aggregation**: Built-in support for cross-aspect analysis
- **Version Control**: Track changes over time

## Usage Examples

### Creating a GRI Report
```python
# Create waste generation report (GRI 306-3)
report = GriReport(
    gri_type=GriType.GRI_306_3,
    organization_id=org.id,
    reporting_period="2024-Q1",
    waste_generated_total=1500.5,  # tonnes
    hazardous_waste=150.2,
    non_hazardous_waste=1350.3,
    metrics_data={
        "plastic": 500.0,
        "paper": 400.0,
        "organic": 350.3,
        "metal": 250.0
    }
)
```

### Setting Goals
```python
# Set annual waste reduction target
goal = GriGoal(
    gri_type=GriType.GRI_306_3,
    target_year=2024,
    target_metric="waste_generated_total",
    target_value=1200.0,  # 20% reduction target
    baseline_value=1500.0
)
```

### Analytics Query
```python
# Get waste trend analysis
analytics = GriAnalytics.query.filter(
    GriAnalytics.gri_type == GriType.GRI_306_3,
    GriAnalytics.date_range == "2024"
).all()
```

## Compliance Mapping

| GRI Standard | Database Field | Calculation Method |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 306-1 | waste_impacts | Source analysis + Impact assessment |
| 306-2 | management_actions | Initiative tracking + Effectiveness measure |
| 306-3 | waste_generated_total | Sum of all waste streams |

## Export Formats

### Dashboard Integration
- **Power BI**: Direct SQL connection
- **Tableau**: REST API endpoints
- **Google Data Studio**: CSV export
- **Custom Dashboards**: JSON API

### Report Formats
- **Excel**: Multi-sheet workbooks with charts
- **PDF**: Formatted sustainability reports
- **CSV**: Raw data for analysis
- **JSON**: Structured data for APIs

## Best Practices

1. **Data Collection**: Regular monthly updates for accurate trends
2. **Goal Setting**: SMART targets aligned with corporate sustainability goals
3. **Verification**: Third-party audit trails for credibility
4. **Benchmarking**: Industry comparison capabilities
